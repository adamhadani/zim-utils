zim-utils
---------

This is a set of some simple utilities to work with the zim file format.
I wrote these for the purpose of getting simple to use text dumps from the wikipedia
Release version, and was alittle frustrated by the lack of any existing code / documentation
to do this.

the zim file format is currently used by Wikipedia for their Wikipedia Release version.
This format is typically used for offline browsing with software such as Kiwix.
for more details on these see:

Installing
----------
To compile / install these, one first needs to have the zimlib library installed. This in itself
is not fully automatic, and requires some manual work currently. 

Here's the quickest way to get up and running with the pre-requisites:

1. Install liblzma library

  on Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install liblzma-dev

2. Install cxxtools library

  This abit tricky since the version currently available on Ubuntu repository is lacking some needed headers.
  To install from SVN:

  svn co https://cxxtools.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cxxtools/trunk/cxxtools cxxtools 
  cd cxxtools
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure && make && sudo make install
	
3. Install zimlib

  svn co http://svn.openzim.org/svnroot/trunk/zimlib zimlib
  cd zimlib
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure && make && sudo make install


Once these are all installed, you should be able to easily build all the zim-utils executables using the provided Makefile

Usage
